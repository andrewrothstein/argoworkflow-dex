Dex Integration for Argo workflow without argocd dex
- [Argo Workflow Dex Integration Using Microsoft Connector](https://github.com/tiwarisanjay/argoworkflow-dex/blob/develop/charts/awdex-microsoft/README.md)
- [Argo Workflow Dex Integration Using GitHub Connector](https://github.com/tiwarisanjay/argoworkflow-dex/blob/develop/charts/awdex-github/README.md)
- KeyCloak & Okta is supported directly in Argo workflow. So no Dex integration needed for the same.
